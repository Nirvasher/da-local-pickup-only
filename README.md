# da-local-pickup-only
This is a very simple plugin for Woocommerce that let's you set products as only available for local pickup only. Create the weight class for the product that you want to enable "local pickup only" for. Take the slug for the weight class and change the slug in the plugin. Install it in Wordpress and you are ready to go.

Might make a better version later.
